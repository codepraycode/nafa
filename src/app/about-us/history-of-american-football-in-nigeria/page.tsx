                            Since the 2011s American football has been an interest to African youth, as their counterparts in the Western World have been making wave in the sport over the years. In June 2011 the Nigerian Institute of American Football was created, by 3 American Former-Athletes, Daryl Hayes (an assistant coach at Shepherd University of West Virginia), Ricardo Dickerson (Oakland Raiders), and Gregory Hendricks (former Basketball Pro./coach). The Institutes goal as of that time was to teach eager young players and interested coaches the basics of the sport.

                            At the same time, the first Nigerian American Football Team was created (A.B.U TITANS). After this, it was noticed that the interest was not only in West Africa, as teams and leagues began to spring up in North Africa, in Egypt and Morocco. A few years later, Nigeria had its second team created and this happened also in other parts of West Africa, like Ivory Coast and other countries across Africa.
